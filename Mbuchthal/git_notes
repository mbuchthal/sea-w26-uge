Git notes from 3/28 workshop

Repository - stores files and their changes over time

$git config --global user.name "[name]"
$git config --global user.email "[email]"

$git init - creats hidden .git folder repository in current directory
$la - will show all including .git
git status - views staging area
git add - adds to staging area
git commit (-m 'with notes') - commits changes; like a time stamp with 5 things: changes, timestamp, signature, id, message
git log - to see changes in commits
git ll - list longform
git la - lists all

Workflow:
1. init a repository once
2. add a file and commit,
3. modify, add, and commit ... cyle

Labels:
master - labelled first commit and most recent
HEAD - labelled first commit and most recent commit in active branch
branch(es) - different branches can have labels

git branch - to list branches
git checkout [name] - to change branch

subl . - will open all files in current directory to sublime text editor

git merge - will merge branch into destination.  The branch remains
git branch -d -- will delete branch
